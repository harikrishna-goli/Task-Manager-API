## 🏁 Starting Point

The starting point is **scaffolding the project structure and environment setup**. Before writing endpoints, you need a clean foundation:

1. **Initialize Git Repository**
   - Create a new repo (`task-manager-api`).
   - Add `.gitignore` for Python, Docker, and environment files.

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Create `.env` and `.env.test` files with DB connection strings and JWT secrets.
   - Define a `config.py` to load settings via Pydantic.

3. **Project Structure**
   - Set up directories: `app/` (API, models, schemas), `tests/`, `alembic/`.
   - Add `docker-compose.yml` with API + DB services.

4. **Dependencies**
   - Install FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, psycopg2, python-jose, passlib, pytest.
   - Add a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`.

5. **Database Base**
   - Define `Base` (SQLAlchemy declarative base).
   - Configure `SessionLocal` for DB connections.

6. **Hello World API**
   - Create `main.py` with a simple FastAPI app.
   - Run it inside Docker to confirm setup works.

## 🔑 Brutal Honesty

The **real starting point** isn’t coding tasks or JWT yet — it’s making sure your **environment is reproducible**. If you skip Docker + Alembic setup early, you’ll fight config drift later. The first milestone should be:  
- Run `docker compose up` → API container starts.  
- Run `alembic upgrade head` → DB schema is created.  
- Run `pytest` → tests execute against isolated DB.  

Once that foundation is solid, building features (auth, tasks, filters) becomes straightforward.

👉 Do you want me to **list the exact dependencies and versions** you should pin down in `requirements.txt` as the very first step? That way you can bootstrap the environment cleanly before diving into models and endpoints.
